# DOCS

This is my main docs page...

There are only two peieces of Documentation so far:  

1. [Using Git in 10 Commands](https://github.com/redfrogred/DOCS/blob/main/GIT_DOC.md)
2. [Fixes and Gotchas](https://github.com/redfrogred/DOCS/blob/main/FIXES_DOCS.md)

It is my firm belief that *this is all I need to prosper!*
